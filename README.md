# Coding Exercises

Solutions to problems from *Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills*, by Brian P. Hogan. Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2015. Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programmers-Challenges-Develop-Coding-ebook/dp/B0170Q50LK

The exercises are language-agnostic; I used Python 3.8. Since the exercises are quite simple, I have tried to make the solutions as efficient and Pythonic as possible. In some cases, I've made the challenges more interesting, e.g. with command line arguments instead of `input()` prompts. 

Comments and suggestions welcome!
